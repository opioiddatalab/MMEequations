    "## Origins and evolution\n",
    "The concept of comapring the relative potency of opioid molecules to each other (or morphine) has its roots in clinical pharmacology, appearing in the biomedical literature [around 1960](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13631610/), and codified in the essential textbook Goodman and Gilman's [The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodman_%26_Gilman%27s_The_Pharmacological_Basis_of_Therapeutics). About 40 years ago, as new opioid molecules were becoming available for routine medical use, equianalgesic potency conversions were developed to assist clinical decision making when switching a patient from one opioid compound to another. In 1985, [Foley](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2582259-the-treatment-of-cancer-pain/) formalized clinical practice for cancer pain management into an equianalgesic conversion table that serves as the archetype. Conversion tables started appearing in drug labels in the 1990s. The concept was attractive and one such table was notoriously [embeded in a pen](https://opioiddatalab.github.io/MMEequations/docs/OxyContinMMEpen.png) as a marketing leave-behind. By 2001, [controversy was brewing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11369161-accuracy-in-equianalgesic-dosing-conversion-dilemmas/) on how to use the conversion factors among clinicians, with [specific concern](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11495714-equianalgesic-dose-ratios-for-opioids-a-critical-review-and-proposals-for-long-term-dosing/) over the conversion factor for long-acting opioid methadone, which had emerged as a common chornic pain management option. Later, [Fudin et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4809343/), [Shaheen et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19735901-opioid-equianalgesic-tables-are-they-all-equally-dangerous/) and others detailed why the use of conversion factors is deeply questionable, not in the least because they do not take into account elimination half-life. To our knowledge, in 2006 the first documented use of morphine equivalents in an epidemiology study was published by [Dasgupta et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16236466-association-between-non-medical-and-prescriptive-usage-of-opioids/), with a comprehensive conversion table assembled from various sources including drug labels. The original use showed API-level plots before the summarized version with MME, allowing for heterogeneity to be expressed alongside broader patterns across opioids.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "During this time, several [professional organizations](https://www.nhms.org/sites/default/files/Pdfs/Opioid-Comparison-Chart-Prescriber-Letter-2012.pdf) and [other groups](healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/Pain/cot/VADoDOTCPG022717.pdf) created equianalgesic tables with varying conversion factors. Around 2010, Len Paulozzi at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started circulating annaul [spreadsheets](http://opioiddatalab.github.io/MMEequations/docs/CDC%20NDC%20codes%202010.xlsx) with NDC and equianalgesic potency to researchers via email listservs. This [particular set](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/pdf/calculating_total_daily_dose-a.pdf) of conversion factors soon became the standard for research studies, but only offered guidance on measuring MME in a single prescription, and did not address overlapping scripts. In 2016, CDC issued [guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmmwr%2Fvolumes%2F65%2Frr%2Frr6501e1er.htm) for pain management that included strong cautions for opioid use above an arbitrary MME threshold, thereby suggesting a metric for intervention evaluation and surveillance, still with little regard to how to account for overlapping prescriptions. State laws and insurance policies with MME limits rapidly evolved, invoking the guidelines. Since 2015 there has been rapid increase in the number of publications using MME for epidemiologic studies, however, there is still no standard way for calculating MME in large healthcare datasets. In addition, there is little agreement on how to calculate MME for liquid medicines and non-oral routes of administration. Despite little agreement on the best use of MME, some have even [called for](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11916-018-0695-3) MME to appear on drug packaging.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "When used clinically, MME is an instantaneous mesaure used at the point of care, with an understanding of patient context. For example, when switching a patient to another opioid because of side effects, the remaining pills from the discontinued opioid will not be included in the calculation, however, in epidmeiology studies they will be. In this way, **epidemiology approaches will overestimate *prescribed* exposure; and *underestimate* exposure from unsanctioned sources**.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "There is exposure ascertainment heterogeneity across the observational studies cited in the CDC Guidelines, creating opportunity for misclassification as we have previously [stated](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pds.4564). Yet, that these studies uniformly found increasing risk with exposure, regardless of formula used, demonstrates the fallibility of the existence of a hard threshold for overdose outcomes, as has been [pointed out](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pds.4366).\n",

    "MME are routinely used in epidemiologic studies of opioid utilization today. The ease of calculation, based solely on arithmetic, coupled with the molecular underpinnings, create an ideal level of cognitive complexity to engender MMEs with an aura of authority. Collectively, MME offer the potential to agglomerate opioid compounds to create a summary metric for population level research and policy, similar to blood alcohol concentrations. However, this approach also obscures nuance between opioid compounds and formulations that may be worth of exploration.\n",

The WTD methods arose out of neccesity; major Danish health datasets do not have indication, dosage, or refill information, making it impossible to observe when someone has stopped taking a drug (e.g., defining the end of the exposed period, or right administrative censoring). Thw WTD and IAD models take advatange of observed time between prescription refills to estimate how long people *actually take* to consume the medicines they are prescribed. It turns out that these distributions can be modeled with considerable (statistical) efficiency using parametric equations, meaning that patients are fairly consistent when they go get refills (including people at the extremes, which too is predictable) for other chronic conditions. Obviously opioids are complex, with acute and chronic pain both possible, so [we are carefully exploring](https://github.com/opioiddatalab/WTD/blob/master/opioidsWTD.ipynb) the feasability of using this measure in opioid studies.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "[Ranapurwala et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pds.4564) reviewed the 36 studies cited in the CDC Guidelines. The verbatim text from Methods sections of the studies using MME per day are reproduced below. Some studies used *maximum* MME. Some used a calendar based time period. Some summed the days supply. However, despite stating in words what was apparent to the investigators, only a handful provided enough detail to reproduce the exact calculation of average daily MME.\n",

    "**Bhonert 2011**: Next, each patient’s total maximum daily dose for each day of the study observation period was calculated by add- ing the daily doses of all fills that covered that particular day. The specific daily dose contributed by each fill was determined by dividing the total morphine-equivalent milligrams dispensed in that fill by the number of days supplied. This measurement of dose reflects the maximum daily dose prescribed and not necessarily the actual amount consumed. Morphine- equivalent maximum daily dose was converted into a categorical variable with the values of 0 mg, 1 mg to less than 20 mg, 20 mg to less than 50 mg, 50 mg to less than 100 mg, and 100 mg or more. In addition, a time-varying indicator of whether patients were pre- scribed a regularly scheduled opioid plus a simultaneous as-needed opioid was coded for each day of the study observation period that a patient had at least 1 opioid prescription using the fol- lowing 3 mutually exclusive categories: 0, only regularly scheduled opioids; 1, only as-needed opioids; or 2, both a regularly scheduled opioid and as-needed opioid prescriptions.\n",

    "**Boscarino 2016**: counting the number of prescription orders in the EHRs in the past 12 months before OD (0, 1–2, 3–8, 9+ orders. We note that calculation of a “morphine equivalent dose” is limited with nonplan members, because these types of patients may receive opioids from multiple sources and prescription claims data are unavailable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cochran 2016**:MME was constructed by converting total within-episode opioid supply into morphine equivalents, dividing by days supplied, and coding into 4 levels (Z 100 MME/d, 50– < 100 MME/d, 20– < 50 MME/d, <20 MME/d). Level of MME/day varied by individual across episodes.\n",

    "**Dunn 2010**: We then calculated the average daily morphine equivalent dose dispensed for 90-day exposure windows by adding the morphine equivalents for the prescriptions dispensed during the 90 days and then dividing by 90. For each 90-day exposure window and each person, we calculated the average daily opioid dose dispensed and divided these into 5 categories: none, 1 to 19 mg, 20 to 49 mg, 50 to 99 mg, and 100 mg or more. We included opioid dose as a time-varying covariate, estimated for continuously updated 90-day exposure windows. Participants could be classified as either exposed to opioids (at any of 4 dosage levels) or unexposed on any given day, on the basis of their average daily opioid dose during the previous 90 days, including the event date. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Edlund 2014**: Average daily dose was measured in morphine equivalents and grouped as none (0 mg), low dose (1–36 mg), medium dose (36–120 mg), and high dose (120+mg). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Gomes 2011**: The dose of opioid was calculated as the number of tablets dispensed multiplied by the strength of the pills (in milligrams) for each prescription. The average daily dose for each of these prescriptions was then calculated as the dose (in milligrams) divided by the number of days’ supply for which the prescription was written, converted to morphine equivalents using morphine equivalence ratios used by the Canadian National Opioid Use Guideline Group. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Gomes 2011 Open Med**: For each individual who received at least one opioid prescription in a given calendar year, we calculated the mean daily dose dispensed (mg) of oral morphine, or equivalent, on the basis of the person’s first 90 days of opioid therapy. If the supply of drug dispensed for a prescription in that interval extended beyond 90 days, we excluded the excess. The adjusted total amount of morphine equivalents dispensed over the 90 days was divided by 90 to obtain the mean daily dose for the period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Baumblatt 2014**:  To calculate the mean daily dosage, all opioid prescriptions were combined and converted to MMEs and divided by 365 days. We categorized mean daily dosage into less than20,20to40,41to80,81to100,101to200,201to400, and more than 400 MMEs/d and defined high risk as a mean of more than 100 MMEs/d for a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ilgen 2016**: Maximum morphine-equivalent daily opioid dose was modeled as time-varying and recoded into the following categories: 0 mg, 1 to ,20 mg/d, 20 to ,50 mg/d, 50 to ,100 mg/d, and 1001 mg/d.2,10 These dosage categories were chosen to allow for comparison with other published work on unintentional overdose2 as well recent recommendations that caution against prescribing more than 90 to 100 mg/d.25 To avoid double-counting dosage, opioid fills that seemed to be contin- uations of the same treatment plan (ie, were the same opioid formulation and dosage) were assumed to not start until the end of the days’ supply of the previous fill. Also consistent with the Bohnert article,25 for each day that an individual had at least 1 opioid prescription, a 3-level time-varying indicator of opioid fill type was calculated to reflect schedule, with the categories of: only regularly scheduled opioids; only pro re nata (PRN) opioids; or both regularly scheduled opioid and PRN opioid prescriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LaRochelle 2016**: We calculated the morphine-equivalent dos- age (MED) for each opioid dispensing using estab- lished conversion tables (14). We calculated a daily MED by distributing the total MED for each dispensing over the days supplied and summing the total of over- lapping dispensings on each day.\n",
    "*Good figure illustrating approach to MME calculationg with overlapping scripts.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Liang 2005**: We calculated the mean daily MED for filled opioid prescriptions for each 6-month interval by dividing the total MED by total days'; supply covered by all these prescriptions. The *total MED* was computed from all opioids dispensed in a 6-month interval multiplied by strength (in milligrams) and then multiplied by a morphine equivalent conversion factor derived from published data,10,23 conversion tables on the Internet, and drug information resources\n",
    "\n",
    "**Liang 2006**: As reported previously, total morphine equivalent dose was calculated from all filled opioid prescriptions over 6 months as well as average daily dose over this time- frame [14,15]. As in other studies, average daily opioid dose was examined in four categories: <20, 20–49, 50– 99, and >100 mg [12,14–17]; and total opioid dose was examined in four categories: >190, 191–450, 451– 1830, and >1830 mg [14] [16]. We created a three-level opioid dose factor (High if daily dose > 100 mg; Medium if daily dose 50–99 mg and total dose > 1830 mg; Low for all others). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Miller 2005**: To assess and control for the effect of the opioid dose, we con- verted each opioid agent to the morphine-equivalent dose fol- lowing the method of Von Korff et al.17 We computed the mor- phine-equivalent mean daily dose by dividing the total quantity prescribed by days’ supply and converted the daily dose thus calculated into a corresponding morphine-equivalent dose. After the conversion, prescriptions in morphine-equivalent mean daily doses were categorized as 1 mg to less than 20 mg, 20 mg to less than 50 mg, 50 mg to less than 100 mg, and 100 mg or greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naliboff 2011**: Opioid medication dosages were taken from the com- puterized pharmacy record and were converted into morphine equivalents per day in order to have a stan- dardized unit for reporting opioid amounts across differ- ent drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Paulozzi 2012**: we calculated the dosage of opioid prescribed in MME per day [27] in three different ways. The single peak dosage was the highest amount per day in any single opioid prescription. The total peak dosage was the highest dosage per day at any time during the exposure period after summing dosages from all overlapping opioid prescriptions. The average dosage was the average daily opioid dosage during the entire study period from all opioid prescriptions combined. For regression analysis, we categorized each measure of daily dosage into 0–40, >40–120, and >120 MME/day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Paulozzi 2014**: Indicators of general opioid use included the mean and median days of use (where one or more opioid prescriptions was active) and mean and median daily dosages for opioids in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ray 2016**: The analysis included a time-dependent analysis of the relation of duration of study drug therapy and dose during follow-up to total study mortality. Duration was defined as cu- mulative dispensed days of therapy on the day a study drug prescription was filled. Cut points for low (≤cut point) vs high dose (>cut point) were the approximate median time- dependent doses: 60-mg/d morphine equivalents, 600- mg/d gabapentin equivalents, and 40-mg/d amitriptyline equivalents. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sullivan 2010**: Opioid dose per day supplied was calculated by adding the total morphine equivalents for the three major opioid groups and dividing by the sum of the total days supply (assuming maximum authorized use as calculated by the dispensing pharmacist). If the total days supply exceeded the number of days in the period (180 days), suggesting concurrent use of different opioid types, the daily dose was calculated by dividing the total dose dispensed by 180 days. \n",

    "**Turner 2015**: The total MED was computed by summing the MEDs for all opioid prescriptions within a given 6-month interval. The mean daily MED in a 6-month interval was calculated by dividing the total MED by days’ supply for all prescrip- tions in that interval, excluding overlapping days. We ex- amined five categories for the mean daily MED (i.e., 0, 1– 19, 20–49, 50–99, and ≥100 mg), similar to other stud- ies.9,10 For the first overdose, the mean daily MED was based on data from exactly 6 months before that event\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zedler 2014**: For each opioid prescription dispensed during the baseline period, the product of the number of units dispensed and the opioid strength per unit (milligrams) was divided by the number of days supplied. The resulting opioid daily dose dispensed (milligrams per day) was then multiplied by a conversion factor derived from published sources to estimate the daily dose in morphine equivalents (MED) (see Table 2) [37–42]. The maximum prescribed daily MED during the baseline period was calculated for each patient by summing the daily MED for all opioid prescriptions dispensed to the patient during those 6 months. It reflects the maximum prescribed daily dose and not necessarily the actual amount consumed."
