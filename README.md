# MME Equations

The intent of this analysis is to document different formulae used to calculate average daily MME, and examine conditions which may lead to bias.

[For example](https://opioiddatalab.github.io/MMEequations/MMEequations.html), across 6 formulae, for 2 simple prescriptions dispensed to the same patient on the same day for the same active ingredient, the following values of **average daily MME** were observed:

+ 50.0
+ 68.6
+ 84.7
+ 100.0
+ 123.3
+ 137.3

The arithmetic details of how average daily MME is calculated can have a tremendous impact on interpretation. Yet, almost no publications include an explicit formula that would allow the results to be replicated.
