The intent of this analysis is to document different formulae used to calculate average daily MME, and examine conditions which may lead to bias.

For example, across 4 common formulae, for 2 simple prescriptions dispensed to the same patient on the same day for the same active ingredient, the following values of **30-day average daily MME** were observed:

+ 76 MME/day
+ 94 MME/day
+ 94 MME/day
+ 53 MME/day

**So, is this a "high dose" average daily MME by the arbitrary 90 MME/day standard?**<br>

The arithmetic details of how average daily MME is calculated can have a tremendous impact on interpretation. Yet, almost no publications include an explicit formula that would allow the results to be replicated.
